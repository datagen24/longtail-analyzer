- Always create a new branch for each bug, feature, or change. Do not work directly on the main branch.
- Follow this workflow for every change:
  1. Identify the bug or required change and open a corresponding GitHub issue for tracking.
  2. Create a new branch from the latest main, named after the issue (e.g., `bugfix/issue-123-description` or `feature/issue-456-description`).
  3. Make code changes in the new branch.
  4. Write or update tests to cover the change.
  5. Update documentation, including implementation docs in `docs/`, and update `enhancements.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` as appropriate.
  6. Commit changes with clear, issue-referencing messages.
  7. Push the branch to the remote repository.
  8. Create a pull request referencing the related issue, using a Markdown-formatted file for the PR body with the GitHub CLI (`--body-file`).
  9. After review and merge, delete the feature/bugfix branch.
- This process ensures clean branch history, traceability, and up-to-date documentation for every change.
