- MUST implement JSON-RPC 2.0 as the wire protocol for all MCP communications.
- MUST support stateful connections with proper session management during MCP lifecycle.
- MUST implement capability negotiation during initialization phase.
- MUST provide one or more of: Resources, Tools, or Prompts as defined in MCP specification.
- MUST follow semantic versioning for server versions and protocol compatibility.
- JSON-RPC messages MUST include: "jsonrpc": "2.0", proper id handling, and correct method/result structure.
- Handle initialize method first, negotiate protocol version, respond with server capabilities.
- Wait for initialized notification before processing other requests.
- Implement required methods based on declared capabilities: tools/list, tools/call, resources/list, resources/read, prompts/list, prompts/get.
- Only declare capabilities that are actually implemented and functional.
