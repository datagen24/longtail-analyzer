- Implement comprehensive input validation for all tool arguments and resource requests.
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks using absolute path validation.
- Use command allowlists and never execute arbitrary user-provided commands.
- Implement explicit user consent flows for potentially dangerous operations.
- Validate all inputs against JSON schemas before processing tool calls or resource access.
- Use shell=False for subprocess execution and proper argument parsing with shlex.
- Enforce timeout limits on all external operations and tool executions.
- Implement rate limiting and concurrent operation controls to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, never hardcode credentials.
- Follow principle of least privilege for file system access and external service permissions.
