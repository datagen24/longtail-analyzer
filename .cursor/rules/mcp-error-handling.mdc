- Implement robust error handling for all MCP method handlers with proper JSON-RPC error codes.
- Use standard JSON-RPC error codes: PARSE_ERROR (-32700), INVALID_REQUEST (-32600), METHOD_NOT_FOUND (-32601), INVALID_PARAMS (-32602), INTERNAL_ERROR (-32603).
- Server-defined errors start at -32000 and should include descriptive messages.
- Wrap all tool and resource execution logic in try-catch blocks with detailed error logging to stderr.
- Return valid JSON-RPC error responses instead of crashing the server process.
- Log errors with context including request ID, method name, and relevant parameters.
- Validate all inputs against schemas before processing and return appropriate validation errors.
- Handle timeouts, resource limitations, and external service failures gracefully.
- Never expose internal system details or stack traces in error responses to clients.
